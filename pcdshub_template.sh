# 2. Change the write permissions so that nobody but you can rwx it:
#    chmod 700 ~/.pcdshub.sh
# 3. Replace the information as appropriate.
# 4. Set your git config to use the env var to authenticate https pushes.
#    Make sure to include your username in this command as appropriate:
#    git config --global credential.helper '!f() { echo username=yourghusername; echo "password=$GH_TOKEN"; };f'
